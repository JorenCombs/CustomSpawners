0.3:
Players can be given the right to pick up mob spawners
Permissions
- customspawners.pickupspawner - when user breaks a mob spawner, a spawner item will be dropped on the ground
- customspawners.setdelay - set the delay until the next mob spawns (only works once)
- customspawners.<creature type> - set a spawner to spawn <creature type>

0.2:
Future-proofing:  switched to use list of CreatureTypes provided through Bukkit.
- Now generates default config using this.
- If existing config does NOT have the desired CreatureType, then try setting the spawner to the CaseSensitiveName from the CreatureType enum.
- Sadly, does not use Spawn's parameters system (yet)

0.1:
Added /creaturespawner (/spawner /cs aliases) command to read from and customize mob spawners
